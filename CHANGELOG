*1.1.2* 28 May 2008

* Me <Thomas Maurer> pushed the plugin to GitHub (mainly for using as git submodule)
* module Leftbee::HTMLHelpers renamed to generic and consitent way of classes in 
  Rails (like HTML::Sanitizer): HTML::EntityCoder

*1.1.1* 22 August 2006

* module Leftbee::HTMLHelper renamed to Leftbee::HTMLHelpers to be consistent with the name of the plugin and the documentation!


*1.1* 21 August 2006

* Slight refactoring to allow the inclusion of the helpers in any class more easily.
